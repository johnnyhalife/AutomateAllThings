# Automate all the things! by Johnny Halife @ HTML5 Dev Conference San Francisco 2014
In this course we'll walkthrough the process of doing automating the most common tasks from the development process from scratch, we will start with an existing Node.js Application, automate the workflow and we'll end up having it configured under a Continuous Deployment System.

The main idea of a full day course is to learn how to Setup CI by doing it, and leave a chunk of time to setup your own project under CI, no matter if it's an Open Source Library or setup your own CI Server.

I decided to build this course after the success of "Mastering the Build Process" talk I gave last year (on Oct), which was really practical but now I want to take it one step forward and help attendees to learn by doing.
